# my-profile-spa

A minimal Vue 3 + Vite single-page application scaffold created inside this workspace.

Quick start:

```bash
cd my-profile-spa
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This project uses `vue` and `vue-router` with `vite` as bundler.
- Copy content from your existing `index.html`, `projects.html`, and `experience.html` into the Vue components as needed.
